## Event Transfer
## Signature `event` Transfer(address,address,uint256)


Emitted when `value` tokens are moved from one account (`from`) to
another (`to`).
Note that `value` may be zero.

**Params**

## Event Approval
## Signature `event` Approval(address,address,uint256)

# Function decimals

Dev Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
be displayed to a user as `5,05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).
Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless {_setupDecimals} is
called.
NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
{IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.

# Function _transfer

# Function _setupDecimals

Dev Sets {decimals} to a value other than the default one of 18.
WARNING: This function should only be called from the constructor. Most
applications that interact with token contracts will not expect
{decimals} to ever change, and may work incorrectly if it does.

# Function _beforeTokenTransfer

Dev Hook that is called before any transfer of tokens. This includes
minting and burning.
Calling conditions:
- when `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens
will be to transferred to `to`.
- when `from` is zero, `amount` tokens will be minted for `to`.
- when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens will be burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.
